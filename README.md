# Movie Discover
This film discovery application offers users the opportunity to explore movies and TV series using data provided by the TMDB API. The main screen allows users to switch between movie and TV show lists using the buttons located at the top. The movie list includes categories such as Top Rated, Popular, Now Playing, and Upcoming, while the TV series list includes Top Rated, Popular, On The Air, and Airing Today.

Within the application, when a movie or TV series is selected from the listed items, its details are displayed on a detail screen for the user. This detail screen provides information such as the release date, average vote, overview, cast, and similar content. Users can thus get comprehensive information about the selected movie or TV show.
